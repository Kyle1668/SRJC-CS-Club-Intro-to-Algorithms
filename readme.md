#### Summary
A strong knowledge of data structures and algorithms is an essential tool for any aspiring software developer and the foundation of most technical interviews. This course which is MIT’s equivalent of CS11 goes into greater depth. It is taught with a pure academic computer science approach, thus there will be an emphasis on a mathematical mindset.

While rigorous, proceeding through this course as a steady pace together will allow us to lean on each other for supports and teach one another. If you stick with this course and work to internalize the concepts, you will come out a much better programmer and able to easily tackle technical interviews and upper division computer science coursework.  This is a group project, thus besides learning the material ourselves, we equally want to help others.

#### Organization
The plan is that we will all do the required reading and work on the homework in between and during meetings. Our time in club meetings will be geared towards reviewing the previous week’s material, helping anybody who’s struggling with any concepts, and preview upcoming material.

#### What is an Open Course?
An open course is when a university posts recordings of all the lectures, homework assignments, solutions, and any other class material online for free. You do not enroll into any program and you will not receive any credit. Think of it almost like a giant tutorial. The course page can be confusing so I’ll be posting the general resources here. If you’re confused at any point on what material you should be going over, do not hesitate to reach out to other for guidance.
